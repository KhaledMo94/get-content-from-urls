# get-content-from-urls
fetching website pages and get them as text files from urls

I used DOMDocument php built-in class

you can custom tags that required to be removed before processing by removing or adding to
removeTagsFromDom() function in index.php

resulted files are stored in result directory within root directory each named as
sentized url name.
